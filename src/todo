-> Set pythonpath and environment properly. Use sitepackages for published code, pythonpath or sysenv
-> Index postgres db based on encodings when encodings exceed 10k entries
-> Map cameras properly
-> Remove prints and add logs
-> Bug: shutdown_system needs some time to recognize before killing
-> Increase numprocesses dynamically
-> add code to install pip programs to orchestrator


To do after 1.0 backend:
-> Handle employee
-> In mem cache to improve performance
-> Performance tests with 10k faces
-> Replace keras vgg face source_input Error
-> Run sample keras program first

Research and experiment oriented:
-> Look into frame differencing
-> Fischer face recognition
-> Group faces together based on time and similarity (dynamic similarity). <- frame differencing
